            <p class="secintro">I'm still a student, looking for a part time job I can do while still at school,
                ideally working remotely. I’m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming
                languages, step by step. Have two brothers, both of them study at a med school, so it is quite funny
                that I, as a girl, decided for software engineering. I try to get the most out of my time at the
                college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with
                you</p>
